## Expressions and operators
### Operators

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
#### Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=),
which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
#### Expression
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable.

##### JavaScript has the following expression categories:

+ Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
+ String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
+ Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
+ Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
+ Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

## FunctionsFunctions 
are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value,
but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### Defining functions
> Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword
> Function expressions
While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.

### Calling functions
Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
