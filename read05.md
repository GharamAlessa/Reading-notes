## Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.
+ Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
+ Arithmetic operators
+ Bitwise operators
+ Logical operators
+ String operators
+ Conditional (ternary) operator
+ Comma operator
+ Unary operators
+ Relational operators
Assignment operators
### An assignment operator
assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=)
, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

 |Name	|Shorthand |operator	|Meaning|
 |------|-----------|--------|---------|
|Asignment	| = y	| = y|
 |adition assignment|x += y	| = x + y|
|subtion assignment|x -= y	| = x - y|
 miplication assignment|x *= y|x = x * y|
|dvision assignment|x /= y	| = x / y|

## Expressions
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x.
The expression itself evaluates to seven.
