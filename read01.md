## **What is Markdown?**


*Markdown* is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images,
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Files with the [.md]() or [.markdown]() extension
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.such as :
+ Syntax highlighting
+ Task Lists
+ Tables
+ SHA references
+ Issue references within a repository
+ Username @mentions
+ Automatic linking for URLs
+ Strikethrough
+ Emoji :sweat_smile:	 :sunglasses: :alien:
