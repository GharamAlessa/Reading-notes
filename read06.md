CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is,
with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
## What is CSS for?
As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge ,
are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
## How To Add CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

+ External CSS
+ Internal CSS
+ Inline CSS
