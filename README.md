### **What is the growrth mindset?**

In my own words i believe ***growth mindset*** is that talents can be developed through hard work and good strategies with a lot of patience .

### **What is the difference between growth and fixed mindset?**

 **Fixed Mindset**: People with a fixed mindset believe they are born with their abilities which are fixed and unchangeable, creating a glass ceiling for their success.

 **Growth Mindset**: People with a growth mindset believe their abilities can be developed and strengthened over time through hard work and commitment.
 | Fixed    | Growth |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| avoid challenges     | embraces  it     |   
| lose foucs   | persists        |
|views as fruitless | no pain , no gain |
| ignores | learn from |
| views as threat | is inspierd by |
