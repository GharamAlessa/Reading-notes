# ***Wireframe and Designe***
### 1. What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.
### How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

# ***HTML basics***
###  what is HTML?
*HTML* is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of conten.
