# ***Wireframe and Designe***
### 1. What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.
### How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
