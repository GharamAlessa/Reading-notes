### What is Git?
Git is a version control system, it's on our local machine, we can see our files, what changes are made, why they are made and by who,
the most popular commands using Git are add-commit-push which developers refer to them as ACP

#### Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

> Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

> Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database

### Getting Started

#### Download Git

In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.

Git can be installed in three ways:

+ Install as a package
+ Install via another installer
+ Download and compile the source code.

You can ***download*** Git by visiting this link and following the posted directions:

### Terminal commands :

+ ls : will list for me directories(folders) and files (That are not hidden)

+ ls -la : List all files (with hidden ones)

+ cd (Change Directory) : to open a certain directory(folder), example: cd test -> here I want to open a directory called test

+ cd ..  : to go back from my current directory(folder) to the previous one -> if I'm in test directory and want to go back to the previous one (let's assume it's called testPrevious) then I just type cd ..

+ mkdir :(Make directory) to create a directory(folder) -> mkdir newTest , here I now have a new directory called newTest

+ Directory is a Folder and this folder will have the Files of my project, so if I want to create a file I use: 

+ touch command, and don't forget the extension of the file, example touch index.html will create an HTML file

+ pwd (Print Working Directory) : to see where I am now

+ clear : clears the terminal
